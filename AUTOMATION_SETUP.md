# PR Automation Setup Summary

## Overview

This PR sets up comprehensive GitHub Actions automation for pull requests in the jurnal_mu repository. When a new PR is created, multiple automated workflows will run to help maintain code quality and provide useful information.

## What's Been Added

### 1. **PR Quality Checks** (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`)
Runs on every pull request to `main` or `develop` branches:

- ✅ **PHP Code Style** - Validates PHP code with Laravel Pint
- ✅ **JavaScript/TypeScript Linting** - Checks JS/TS with ESLint
- ✅ **Code Formatting** - Verifies formatting with Prettier
- ✅ **TypeScript Type Checking** - Ensures type safety
- ✅ **Test Suite** - Runs all Pest tests

### 2. **PR Labeler** (`.github/workflows/pr-labeler.yml`)
Automatically labels PRs based on:

- **File changes**: `backend`, `frontend`, `documentation`, `dependencies`, `ci/cd`, `configuration`, `tests`
- **PR size**: `size/xs` (≤10 lines), `size/s` (≤100), `size/m` (≤500), `size/l` (≤1000), `size/xl` (>1000)

### 3. **PR Welcome Message** (`.github/workflows/pr-welcome.yml`)
Posts a friendly welcome comment when PRs are opened with:
- Greeting and checklist
- Information about automated checks
- Guidance for contributors

### 4. **PR Auto Assignment** (`.github/workflows/pr-auto-assign.yml`)
Analyzes PRs and adds helpful context:
- Identifies documentation-only PRs
- Identifies test-only PRs
- Can be extended for automatic reviewer assignment

### 5. **PR Status Update** (`.github/workflows/pr-status-update.yml`)
Updates PRs with quality check results:
- Posts success/failure status
- Links to workflow details
- Updates existing comments to reduce noise

### 6. **Configuration Files**
- `.github/labeler.yml` - Label mapping configuration
- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## How It Works

When you create a pull request:

```
1. 🎉 Welcome message posted
2. 🏷️  Automatic labels applied
3. 🔍 Quality checks run in parallel:
   - PHP linting
   - JS/TS linting
   - Code formatting
   - Type checking
   - Tests
4. 📊 Status update posted with results
5. 💬 Context comments added (if applicable)
```

## Pre-existing Code Issues

**Note:** During testing, I discovered some pre-existing code style issues that are not related to this PR:

### PHP (Laravel Pint)
- 9 test files missing blank line at EOF
- These are minor style issues in existing test files

### Prettier
- 3 files need formatting:
  - `resources/js/app.tsx`
  - `resources/js/pages/dashboard.tsx`
  - `resources/js/ssr.tsx`

These pre-existing issues will be caught by the new workflows but should be fixed in a separate PR to avoid mixing concerns.

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent Code Quality** - Automated checks ensure standards are met  
✅ **Better Organization** - Automatic labels help categorize PRs  
✅ **Improved Onboarding** - Welcome messages guide new contributors  
✅ **Faster Reviews** - Size labels help prioritize review efforts  
✅ **Reduced Noise** - Status updates replace manual checking  

## Running Checks Locally

Before pushing your PR, run these commands locally:

```bash
# PHP linting
./vendor/bin/pint --test

# JavaScript linting
npx eslint .

# Code formatting
npm run format:check

# Type checking
npm run types

# Run tests
./vendor/bin/pest
```

## Customization

All workflows can be customized by editing the files in `.github/workflows/`. See the README in that directory for details.

## Testing

These workflows will be automatically tested on this PR. You should see:
- ✅ All workflows triggered
- 🏷️ Labels automatically applied
- 💬 Welcome message and status updates posted
- ⚠️ Some quality checks may fail due to pre-existing issues (documented above)

## Next Steps

After this PR is merged:
1. Address pre-existing code style issues in a follow-up PR
2. Customize labeler configuration as needed
3. Add more automation as requirements grow
4. Consider adding auto-merge for dependabot PRs
5. Consider adding release automation
