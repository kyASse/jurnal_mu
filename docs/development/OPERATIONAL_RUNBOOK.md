### Incident Severity Matrix

| Severity | Impact | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **P1 - Critical** | System down, no workaround | 15 minutes | Immediate |
| **P2 - High** | Major function unavailable | 1 hour | Within 1 hour |
| **P3 - Medium** | Minor function impaired | 4 hours | Next business day |
| **P4 - Low** | Cosmetic/informational | Next sprint | Not required |

---

### P1: System Completely Down

**Symptoms:**
- Website unreachable (502/503 errors)
- Database connection failures across all pages
- Critical data corruption

**Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes):**
```bash
# 1. Enable maintenance mode (if accessible)
php artisan down --secret="emergency-access-$(date +%s)"
# Share secret URL with team immediately

# 2. Check server status
systemctl status apache2  # or nginx
systemctl status mysql

# 3. Check error logs
tail -100 /var/log/apache2/error.log
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log

# 4. Restart services if needed
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart mysql
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm

# 5. Test basic connectivity
curl -I https://jurnalmu.org
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT 1"

# 6. If services won't start, check disk space
df -h
# If disk full, emergency cleanup:
find /tmp -type f -atime +7 -delete
find storage/logs -name "*.log" -size +100M -delete
```

**Communication (5 minutes):**
```
Subject: P1 INCIDENT - JurnalMu System Down

---

### P2: Major Feature Unavailable

**Examples:**
- Users cannot submit assessments
- Login broken for specific role
- Database queries timing out

**Response Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Confirm issue
# Try to reproduce the exact steps user reported

# 2. Check related logs
grep -i "assessment\|submit" storage/logs/laravel.log | tail -50

# 3. Check queue status (if feature uses queues)
php artisan queue:failed

# 4. Quick fixes to try:
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan queue:restart

# 5. If fix requires code change:
#    - Develop fix
#    - Test on staging
#    - Deploy to production
#    - Monitor

# 6. If cannot fix within 1 hour:
#    - Escalate to development team
#    - Document workaround for users (if any)
```

---

### P3: Minor Function Impaired

**Examples:**
- Slow page load on specific page
- Search not returning expected results
- Email notifications delayed

**Response Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Document the issue
#    - Which page/feature?
#    - Error messages?
#    - Frequency (always, sometimes)?

# 2. Check if widespread or isolated
#    - Ask other users to test
#    - Check from different browsers/devices

# 3. Gather debugging info
#    - Browser console errors
#    - Network tab (slow requests?)
#    - Laravel logs for warnings

# 4. Create GitHub issue with details
#    - Steps to reproduce
#    - Expected vs actual behavior
#    - Screenshots/logs

# 5. Prioritize for next sprint
#    - If simple fix, apply immediately
#    - If complex, schedule for planned maintenance
```

## 🎭 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Locked Out (Forgot Password)

**Situation:** User cannot reset password (email not arriving, reset link expired)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option A: Manually reset password
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = User::where('email', 'user@example.com')->first();
>>> $user->password = Hash::make('TemporaryPassword123!');
>>> $user->save();
>>> exit

# Send temporary password to user via alternative channel (phone, WhatsApp)
# Instruct user to change password immediately
```

**Option B: Resend verification email**
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = User::where('email', 'user@example.com')->first();
>>> $user->sendPasswordResetNotification($token);
>>> exit
```

**Documentation:**
- Log action in ops log
- Note: Password was reset manually for [USER] on [DATE] by [ADMIN]

---

### Scenario 2: Assessment Submission Stuck

**Situation:** User reports "Submit Assessment" button not working

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# 1. Check user's assessment status
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = User::where('email', 'user@example.com')->first();
>>> $assessment = $user->journals()->first()->assessments()->latest()->first();
>>> echo $assessment->status;
>>> exit

# 2. Check validation errors
#    - Are all required indicators answered?
#    - Are file uploads valid?

# 3. Check JavaScript console (ask user for screenshot)

# 4. Check backend logs
grep -i "assessment.*validation" storage/logs/laravel.log | tail -20
```

**Common Fixes:**
1. **Incomplete responses:** Ask user to fill all required fields
2. **File upload issues:** Check file size limits, formats
3. **Session expired:** User should log out and log back in
4. **Cache issue:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

**If data is valid but stuck:**
```bash
# Manually update status (use with caution!)
php artisan tinker
>>> $assessment = Assessment::find([ID]);
>>> $assessment->status = 'submitted';
>>> $assessment->submitted_at = now();
>>> $assessment->save();
>>> exit

# Document this action and investigate root cause
```

---

### Scenario 3: Queue Worker Crashed

**Symptoms:**
- Emails not being sent
- Background jobs not processing
- Failed jobs accumulating

**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Check if worker is running
ps aux | grep "queue:work"

# 2. If not running, start it
cd /path/to/jurnal_mu
nohup php artisan queue:work --tries=3 --timeout=90 > storage/logs/queue.log 2>&1 &

# 3. If using Supervisor (recommended)
sudo supervisorctl status jurnal-mu-worker
sudo supervisorctl restart jurnal-mu-worker

# 4. Process failed jobs
php artisan queue:retry all

# 5. Monitor for 15 minutes
tail -f storage/logs/queue.log
```

**Prevention:**
- Set up Supervisor to auto-restart queue workers
- Monitor queue worker health in daily check

---

### Scenario 4: Database Migration Failed During Deployment

**Situation:** Ran `php artisan migrate` and got error

**DO NOT PANIC. Follow these steps:**

```bash
# 1. Check migration status
php artisan migrate:status
# Identify which migration failed

# 2. Check error message
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log

# 3. Common issues:
#    a) Duplicate column: Migration already partially applied
#    b) Syntax error: Check migration file
#    c) Foreign key constraint: Related table doesn't exist

# 4. If safe to rollback (no data loss risk):
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1

# 5. Fix the migration file, then:
php artisan migrate

# 6. If rollback not safe (production with data):
#    - Do NOT rollback
#    - Manually fix database to match expected state
#    - Mark migration as complete:
php artisan tinker
>>> DB::table('migrations')->insert([
>>>     'migration' => '2025_XX_XX_failed_migration_name',
>>>     'batch' => DB::table('migrations')->max('batch') + 1
>>> ]);
>>> exit
```

**Prevention:**
- Always test migrations on staging first
- Backup database before migrating
- Review migration file for errors

---

### Scenario 5: High Server Load / Slow Performance

**Symptoms:**
- Pages loading slowly (> 5 seconds)
- Timeouts occurring
- Server CPU/memory high

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Check server resources
top
# Identify process using most CPU/RAM

# 2. If Apache/PHP-FPM overloaded:
# Check concurrent requests
ss -tn | grep :80 | wc -l

# 3. Emergency performance boost (temporary):
# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# 4. If database is slow:
# Check for locked tables
mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW PROCESSLIST;"
# If long-running queries, consider killing them:
# mysql -u root -p -e "KILL [PROCESS_ID];"

# 5. Check for malicious traffic
tail -100 /var/log/apache2/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
# If one IP has excessive requests, consider blocking
```

**Long-term fixes:**
- Optimize slow queries
- Add database indexes
- Implement Redis caching
- Scale server resources

---

## 💾 Disaster Recovery

### Scenario: Complete Data Loss

**Situation:** Database corrupted, server died, or catastrophic failure

**Recovery Steps:**

#### 1. Prepare New Environment
```bash
# On new server or fresh install:
git clone [repository]
cd jurnal_mu
composer install --no-dev
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production settings
php artisan key:generate
```

#### 2. Restore Database
```bash
# Locate latest backup
ls -lh /path/to/backups/ | tail -5

# Restore database
gunzip < backup-YYYYMMDD.sql.gz | mysql -u root -p jurnal_mu

# Verify restoration
mysql -u root -p jurnal_mu -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM journals;"
```

#### 3. Restore Uploaded Files
```bash
# If backups include storage/app/public:
tar -xzf storage-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz -C storage/app/

# Re-create symlink
php artisan storage:link
```

#### 4. Verify Application
```bash
# Run migrations (should be up-to-date if backup recent)
php artisan migrate --force

# Clear and cache
php artisan optimize

# Start services
php artisan queue:work &
```

#### 5. Test Critical Paths
- [ ] Login as each role (Super Admin, Admin Kampus, User)
- [ ] View journals list
- [ ] View assessment details
- [ ] Submit test assessment (on staging, not production!)
- [ ] Check file uploads/downloads

#### 6. Bring System Online
```bash
# Remove maintenance mode if enabled
php artisan up

# Monitor logs closely for 24 hours
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 4 hours  
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 24 hours (daily backups)

---

### Backup Restoration Testing (Quarterly)

**Purpose:** Verify backups are valid and restoration procedure works

**Procedure:**
1. Provision temporary staging server
2. Attempt full restoration from latest backup
3. Test application functionality
4. Document any issues encountered
5. Update disaster recovery procedures
6. Destroy temporary server

**Responsibility:** Operations Team
